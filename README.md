# üìâ Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

This project is a supervised machine learning pipeline that predicts **customer churn** using an e-commerce dataset. It includes **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and a live **Gradio web interface** for real-time churn probability prediction.

## üîç Problem Statement

Churn is one of the most critical KPIs in any customer-facing business. This project aims to:
   - Predict whether a customer is likely to **churn (leave)** or **stay**
   - Identify the **factors** that influence churn
   - Provide an **interactive interface** for business users to test scenarios and improve retention strategies

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset is sourced from an e-commerce platform and includes:

- **Behavioral data** (e.g. HourSpendOnApp, OrderCount, Tenure)
- **Demographic data** (e.g. CityTier, Gender, MaritalStatus)
- **Transactional info** (e.g. OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear, CashbackAmount)
- **Target variable**: Churn (Yes/No)

## üß† Model Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables using OneHotEncoder
   - Scaled numerical features with StandardScaler

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Removed non-informative fields (e.g. CustomerID)
   - Checked correlations and feature importances

3. **Model Training**
   - Used RandomForestClassifier and Logistic Regression Model and compare the results to implement a better model
   - Trained using a pipeline via scikit-learn
   - Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC

5. **Model Inference via Gradio**
   - Built an interface to enter feature values
   - Returns churn prediction and churn probability in real time
